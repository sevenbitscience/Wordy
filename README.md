Yeah so it's another wordle clone. I thought it would be a fun challenge to try and make a wordle like game, and I came up with some other challenge modes I want to try.

## Extra Modes
I came up with some other challenge mode I will add.

### No Greens
Even if a letter is in the correct position it will still show yellow

### No Gray's
You can't use grayed out letters in your next guesses

### Number of attempts
You can choose how many attempts you get, from 3 to infinite.
